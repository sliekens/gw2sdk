## About

You must be a contributor to edit this wiki directly. However, everyone can copy, modify and redistribute it without limitation. If you are reading this in a browser, there is a helpful widget in the sidebar to clone this wiki locally.

It's not currently possible to create a pull request for wiki pages. As an alternative, you may create a patch:

1. git clone https://github.com/sliekens/gw2sdk.wiki.git
2. git checkout -b changes
3. now make the changes
4. git add .
5. git commit -m changes
6. git format-patch master

This will create a set of patch files, one per commit. I recommend uploading the patch files to a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) and then creating an issue here with the link to your Gist.
