# Feedback

If you have anything to add, I enabled the discussions board on GitHub just for that. Go to <https://github.com/sliekens/gw2sdk/discussions> and start a New discussion. Let me know over there if you used GW2SDK to build something! If you have a code problem or found a bug, opening an issue is still better.

You can also DM me directly on Discord: sliekens#7232
